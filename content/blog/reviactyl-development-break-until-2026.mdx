## Information

I wanted to share a quick update regarding the development of Reviactyl.
I’ll be taking a short break from active feature development and major updates until January 10th. A little downtime will help me return with fresh energy and clearer focus for the next phase of the project.

### What will still continue during the break?

- Non-feature pull requests
- Translation updates
- Security patches and critical fixes

So while major changes are paused, smaller contributions and important maintenance work are still welcome and will be reviewed.

Thank you for your support, patience, and contributions.
See you again in January with more progress! 💙🚀
