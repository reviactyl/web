Reviactyl is a fork of Pterodactyl, an open-source game server management panel built with PHP, React, and Go. Designed with security in mind, Pterodactyl runs all game servers in isolated Docker containers while exposing a beautiful and intuitive UI to administrators and users. What more are you waiting for? Make game servers a first-class citizen on your platform today.

Reviactyl reimagines the UI/UX, making it more accessible than the barebones Pterodactyl.
