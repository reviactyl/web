Reviactyl provides pre-built Docker images via GitHub Packages. `ghcr.io/reviactyl/panel:latest` is the current latest release, and `ghcr.io/reviactyl/panel:develop` is built automatically from the current `develop` (canary) branch. Deploying the panel in Docker is still a work in progress. While the plan is to make Docker the preferred installation method, we currently recommend the [standard deployment instructions](/docs/panel/getting-started)

This guide requires Docker CE. (Docker Compose has been included in the Docker CLI since v2. Docker Compose v1 is unsupported.) For instructions on installing and configuring Docker, see the [installation guide](/docs/tutorial/installing-docker).

## Using Portainer

This part is optional but Portainer is a great tool for managing docker.

```bash
docker run -d -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```
Go to `http://<ip>:9443` in your browser and setup your local account.


## Basics

The easiest deployment method is using the standard `compose.yml` file.

The following docker compose file has been labeled and has simple explanations of what each line does.

### Create compose.yml

```bash
nano compose.yml
```

```yaml
version: '3.8'
x-common:
  database:
    &db-environment
    # Do not remove the "&db-password" from the end of the line below, it is important
    # for Panel functionality.
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: &db-password "CHANGE_ME"
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "CHANGE_ME_TOO"
  panel:
    &panel-environment
    APP_URL: "http://example.com"
    # A list of valid timezones can be found here: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
    APP_TIMEZONE: "UTC"
    APP_SERVICE_AUTHOR: "noreply@example.com"
    # Uncomment the line below and set to a non-empty value if you want to use Let's Encrypt
    # to generate an SSL certificate for the Panel.
    # LE_EMAIL: ""
  mail:
    &mail-environment
    MAIL_FROM: "noreply@example.com"
    MAIL_DRIVER: "smtp"
    MAIL_HOST: "mail"
    MAIL_PORT: "1025"
    MAIL_USERNAME: ""
    MAIL_PASSWORD: ""
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION: "true"

```

### Starting

From the directory in which the compose file is located, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Back Up Your Encryption Key

The first time the container starts, it will generate an `APP_KEY` which is used as an encryption key. This will be saved automatically, but you should save a copy in a secure place in case you need it later.

```bash
docker compose logs panel | grep 'Generated app key:'
```

### Stopping

The panel will automatically restart if the container crashes or the host restarts.  If you need to non-destructively stop the panel for any reason, navigate back to the directory containing `compose.yml` and run:

```sh
docker compose down
```

### Uninstalling

To uninstall the panel, navigate to the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
