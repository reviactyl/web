    If the above command does not work, please refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on how to install Docker CE on your server.

## Start Docker on Boot

If you are on an operating system with systemd (Ubuntu 16+, Debian 8+, CentOS 7+) run the command below to have Docker start when you boot your machine.

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

## Enabling Swap

On most systems, Docker will be unable to setup swap space by default. You can confirm this by running `docker info` and looking for the output of `WARNING: No swap limit support` near the bottom.

Enabling swap is entirely optional, but we recommended doing it if you will be hosting for others and to prevent OOM errors.

To enable swap, open `/etc/default/grub` as a root user and find the line starting with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. Make
sure the line includes `swapaccount=1` somewhere inside the double-quotes.

After that, run `sudo update-grub` followed by `sudo reboot` to restart the server and have swap enabled.
Below is an example of what the line should look like, _do not copy this line verbatim. It often has additional OS-specific parameters._

```text
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="swapaccount=1"
```

<Callout type="info" title="GRUB Configurations">
    Some Linux distros may ignore `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`.  
    Therefore you might have to use `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` instead should the above variable not work for you.
